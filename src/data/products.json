Improved bluetooth technology offers near lossless audio quality at up to 328ft (100m).\n\nDiscover clear, more natural sounding highs than the competition with ZX9’s signature planar diaphragm tweeter. Equally important is its powerful room-shaking bass courtesy of a 6.5” aluminum alloy bass unit. You’ll be able to enjoy equal sound quality whether in a large room or small den. Furthermore, you will experience new sensations from old songs since it can respond to even the subtle waveforms.",
